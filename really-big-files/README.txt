Really Big Files uploader.  This plugin uses transload it to upload really big files to your S3 service.

== Description ==

Really big files are a headache.  They usually exceed the upload limits of your web server.  The Really Big Files plugin 
uses the Transloadit service to provide a convenient uploader and URL generator for your Really Big Files.
Transloadit handles the file uploading, conversion & other processing for your website or app. They can 
process video, audio, images and documents.

To get started, visit transloadit.com, create an account and a template.  
Come back here with your auth key and template id.  Plug them in here and upload some Really Big Files. 

Single files are really just the start, have a look at the Transloadit demos page for more Really Big 
File procesing ideas.
