# Really Big Files Uploader

Really Big Files Uploader uses transloadit to place "Really Big Files" into a bucket on S3 for you.  Create a template, drop in your 
template ID, and your API key and you are ready to upload some Really Big Files.

## Features

* Works seamlessly with Transloadit, a very simple upload service.
* Set up your TransloadIt template, plug in your creds, and BOOM.  Upload away.

## Contents

The Really Big Files Uploader includes the following files:

* This README, a ChangeLog, and a `gitignore` file.
* A subdirectory called `plugin-name` that represents the core plugin file.

## Installation

1. Copy the `plugin-name` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Navigate to the *Plugins* dashboard page
3. Locate the menu item that reads *TODO*
4. Click on *Activate*

This will activate the Really Big Files Uploader. Because the Boilerplate has no front end functionality, nothing will be added to your theme; however, Really Big Files Uploader will give you a new menu selection in the Dashboard.
